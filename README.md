# Floch

**Floch** is a feedback engine for handwritten Java code designed for pen-and-paper programming exams. It combines a fine-tuned TrOCR model — trained on a synthetic dataset of handwritten Java code spanning key OOP concepts — with an AST-based static analysis pipeline to deliver line-level feedback on syntax, structure, and object-oriented design quality.
