# Lelouch 

**Lelouch** is a feedback engine for scanning and evaluating handwritten Java code in terms of correctness and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) theory. The *scanning part* is implemented by a fine-tuned TrOCR model, and the *evaluation part* is implemented by a fine-tuned LLaMa 3.1:8b model quantized to 4-bits.  

**Aside:** This project is named after *Lelouch Lamperouge*, the lead character in the anime *Code Geass*. Wonderful character, one of my favourites of all time!
